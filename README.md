# What is this?
This repository isn't anything crazy. It's probably the simplest webpage I've ever made that will be deployed onto one of my business's servers.

# What is its purpose?
I've recently had a web server that has been going down at my company (at the time of making this HTML document), so I've decided to make this quick HTML document just for troubleshooting purposes. It will be exposed to the Internet as well as being available on the VPN I use to access this server.

# Can I use it?
Sure! It's just a simple HTML webpage. It's nothing crazy. Put it on your web server (Apache, IIS, whatever service you use). Personally, I'm going to put this onto an Apache webpage and expose it via a Cloudflare Tunnel and have Uptime Kuma (on another server) detect when it goes down.
